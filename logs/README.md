# /logs
This directory contains the log files as output by the `automator.bash run` script. Note that one wants to replicate the generation of these logs, one must first create a `~/Desktop/logs` directory as required by the `automator.bash` script.

## Structure
The substructure of this folder is very straight-forward, each directory contains all log data generated by the experiments. The folder names are named after the following convention: `<experiment_name>(<date_and_time_perfomed>)`.
Note that the substructure of each of these directories is consistent with the following structure:
```
/ratio_n:m                          -- ratio used
    /sharded_true-or-false          -- sharded parameter used
        /workers_x                  -- number of worker threads used
            /clients_y              -- number of clients PER THREAD used
                /dstat              -- all dstat data from machines
                client_r_s_t.log    -- log from client r, subclient s and
                                       repetition t
                mw_r_t.logs         -- log from middleware r and
                                       repetition t
analysis<k>.log                     -- file all logs produced by middleware k
                                       during the entire experiment
system_report<k>.log                -- file containing the system information
                                       logged by middleware k during the
                                       entire experiment
mw_1_ping.logs                      -- ping information run at the beginning
                                       of the experiment to check average
                                       latency between middleware 1 and all
                                       client and server machines.
mw_2_ping.logs                      -- ping information run at the beginning
                                       of the experiment to check average
                                       latency between middleware 2 and all
                                       client and server machines.
```

The only directory not consistent with this is the 2k analysis one having the following structure:
```
/mws_n                              -- number of middlewares used
    /servers_m                      -- number of servers used
        /workers_p                  -- number of worker threads used
            /ratio_k:l              -- ratio used
            /dstat                  -- all dstat data from machines
            client_r_s_t.log        -- log from client r, subclient s and
                                       repetition t
            mw_r_t.logs             -- log from middleware r and
                                       repetition t

```
