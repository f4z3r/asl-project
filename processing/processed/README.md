# /processing/processed
Contains all processed data generated by the `preprocess.py all` and the `handle_dstat.py all` scripts.

## Structure
```
/<experiment_name>
    /dstat.csv                      -- Preprocessed dstat data generated by
                                       handle_dstat.py
    /ratio_k:l
        /sharded_true-of-false
            /workers_m
                /clients_n
                    clients.csv     -- client data with given configuration
                    mws.csv         -- middleware data with given
                                       configuration
```

Again, for the 2k analysis, the substructure is different.
